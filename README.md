# Real World Math Singing Synthesizer (RWMSS)

This is a simple project I made for a school project, and so can have many bugs and may be unstable

It's just for informative purposes, don't use it for any real applications

To edit and create notes/UST, use https://github.com/YellowLime77/RWMSS-Editor, to be used with it
